Escrow is a discord bot built to handle middlemaning transactions between two users for crypto such as Etherum, Bitcoin, and Litecoin as well as Roblox items and in game items such as Adopt Me pets. It is designed to automate the process of middleman transactions, allowing users to complete transactions without the need for a human middleman but with the same level of security and reliability as a human middleman. It has handled over 1000 transactions holding over $100,000 in value and has a 99.9% success rate.

Since this bot was made to handle thousads of dollars worth of deals it had to be built to be as secure as possible. This meant adding in as many checks as possible all while making it a seamless experience for the user. This was a huge challenge and took a lot of time to get right.

Escrow is also one of the only few bots that can handle the trading of in game items such as Adopt Me pets. This was the biggest feat of the project and took a lot of time to get right. I wanted to provide the same experience users were used to with crypto or Roblox items trading but with in game items.

## How it was built

Escrow was built using the Sapphire framework for discord bots.
