Bloxbuy was a specialized marketplace designed to facilitate the buying and selling of Robux, the virtual currency used on the Roblox platform. As the developer of this project, I was hired by a client to create a reliable and convenient platform for users to buy and sell Robux safely.

As this was one of my earlier projects, my tech stack could have been better, but the website was created using next.js and tailwind while the API was built using nest.js, but the entire codebase was written in typescript.

To ensure the platform's security, I implemented various measures such as automation, encryption, and two-factor authentication. These measures were put in place to protect both buyers and sellers and to give users peace of mind when making transactions on the platform.

In addition to security, I also wanted to make the platform as user-friendly as possible. This included offering various payment options and streamlining the transaction process to ensure that it was quick and efficient.

To help sellers track the success of their sales and better understand their customers, I created a dashboard that provided them with various metrics and data. This valuable tool allowed sellers to make informed decisions about their sales strategies and improve their overall performance.

For the site owners, I created a dashboard that provided them with insights into the overall performance of the marketplace. This included data on user activity, sales volumes, and other vital metrics. This data was helpful for the site owners to understand the health of the marketplace and make informed decisions about its future development.

I conducted extensive research to ensure that the marketplace was fully integrated with the Roblox platform and met the needs and preferences of the client's users. I welcomed feedback from my client and their users to help me achieve this goal. Overall, I was proud of the work that I had done on this project and believed that it would be a valuable resource for those looking to buy or sell Robux on the Roblox platform.
