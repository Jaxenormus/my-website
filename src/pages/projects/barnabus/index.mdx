Discord is a popular messaging platform for online communities, and a well-designed bot could significantly enhance the user experience for these groups. That's where my bot, Barnabus, came in.

Barnabus was built initially using javascript as this was one of my earlier projects. I later rewrote it in Typescript to improve the code quality and make it easier to maintain. As for the DB, I used MongoDB initially but later switched to PostgreSQL. I used the discord.js library using the commando framework; later on, moving to discord-akairo for the rewrite.

Barnabus was a multi-purpose Discord bot built with its users, taking as much feedback as possible and implementing it into the final product. One of the standout features of Barnabus was its advanced moderation tools, which allowed moderators to manage their communities and keep things running smoothly and efficiently. These tools included spam and chat filters and user verification, now core parts of Discord. Barnabus also had various games and could stream music from YouTube, making it a versatile choice for Discord servers.

In addition to its core features, Barnabus also had a dashboard that allowed users to monitor their server and configure the bot on the go in an easy-to-use interface. This was a feature that many other bots lacked, and Barnabus' users greatly appreciated it.
Over 100 community owners with 1000s of members added Barnabus, and its success was recognized by Discord, which awarded me a badge that is no longer attainable for having a verified bot. This project was a great introduction to programming for me and a fantastic opportunity to learn and grow as a developer.

Overall, Barnabus was a highly-regarded Discord bot that had something for everyone. Its advanced moderation tools, music streaming, and games, combined with its user-friendly dashboard, made it a must-have for any Discord server looking to take its user experience to the next level. The fact that many of Barnabus' features are now core parts of Discord is a testament to the bot's innovation.
