> Twilid is currently in beta and is not avaliable for public use but you can view the marketing site here: [twilid.com](https://twilid.com) and an example calendar here: [twilid.com/example](https://beta.twilid.com/share/xtdxrfzjtnxdokfb) (most of the example events are in June 2022)

As the developer of Twilid, I am proud to present a feature-packed calendar app specifically designed for business owners and organizations with large audiences. My app helps these users keep their members informed and engaged with important events, providing them with a direct communication channel.

One of the key features that sets Twilid apart from other calendar apps is its ability to coordinate across time zones. This is crucial for businesses and organizations with a global audience, as it ensures everyone can access the calendar and ensure that the time they see is accustomed for them. In addition, Twilid offers a clean and intuitive calendar that allows users to choose what they get notified about, providing a far superior experience for their audience.

I have also incorporated creator-specific features developed through close collaboration with beta testers. This ensures that Twilid is explicitly tailored to the needs of business owners and organizations, providing them with the tools they need to manage and communicate with their audiences effectively.

I have also included advanced shareability options, allowing users to easily share their calendar with others through a link or embed it on their website. This makes it easy for members or followers to stay up-to-date with events and information.

Twilid has also integrated with Zapier, a popular automation tool that allows users to connect their calendars with other apps and services. This further enhances the app's functionality and helps users streamline their workflow.

I am proud to say that Twilid is a bootstrapped project that I am working on solo and its advanced features and customization options make it a standout choice in the crowded market of calendar apps.
